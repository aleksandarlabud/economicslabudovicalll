				<br><b>Meta</b><br>
				“Meta" is one word that is crucial to comprehending the Yu-Gi-Oh economy. Meta is an extremely powerful strategy that is used by several competitive players to dominate tournaments. Basically, what that means is that the meta is whatever card or type of card is popular at a given time. Lots of different aspects of the game help define what the meta is at a given time.  One needs to understand the game's meta in order to comprehend its economics.<br>

				<br><b>Ban list</b><br>

				Not every card is created equally. Some cards are so powerful that the game has prohibited their use. The cards that are banned, limited and semi-limited from the game are listed on the Ban List.
				A prohibited card cannot be used in the game. Limited cards may only be owned once, and semi-limited cards may only be owned twice. All other cards may be included in your Yu-Gi-Oh deck up to three times. Because a card's ban, restriction, or semi-restriction may occasionally affect an entire set of cards. Similar to when a card is removed from the banned list, certain types of decks may become more popular. Depending on what happened to the card, the cards will then either increase in price or decrease in price. Additionally, this may have an impact on the cost of the cards that are compatible with the one that was added to or removed from the lists.
				Every six months, the lists are updated. Many people will try to sell or acquire particular cards before a list is updated, depending on what they anticipate will happen on the ban list. This is quite reminiscent of a stock exchange. When investors believe that a particular type of stock will increase or decrease in value, they will attempt to acquire more of it or sell it at a higher price. Yugioh cards operate similarly The ban list, therefore, has a significant role in the game's meta and economy.
				Ban lists are commonly known to flood the market. A good example is when a ban list hits one of the popular cards. So when a list reduces the number of uses of a card from for example three to two, every single player of that card on the face of this planet now has one extra copy. So now if you were going to sell a card, you would have hundreds of people trying to undercut you to get rid of their copy. That's one way of reaching an overabundance of supply. Too much supply, therefore demand goes down, therefore the price drops.


				<br><b>Tournaments</b><br>

				When a large-scale tournament takes place, everyone in the Yu-Gi-Oh community usually hears about it. Each participant must keep a record of their deck, which is typically posted online for the tournament. People will read these accounts and attempt to create such decks for themselves after seeing that they were successful. The demand for those cards increases along with their price as more individuals uses them. Those who successfully predict the meta can profit greatly from these occasions.


				<br><b>Packs</b><br>
				Another factor of the meta is what packs are coming out now and in the future. Different packs of Yu-Gi-Oh cards have different cards in them. Depending on what’s being released, certain types of decks may become more popular because it’s getting more support. Because of that, the cards that would typically go in those decks become more expensive. Packs include cards of different rarities.  Most cards are a common rarity. Higher rarity cards are often limited to only a couple per box of 30 booster packs or sometimes are only contained in one out of ten boxes. A lot of cards are printed in two different rarities. The higher rarity version of the card will typically be more expensive than the lower rarity. Some sets of cards may only contain a single valuable card, which significantly increases the risk of losing money on the purchase, but also greatly increases the cost of the card in the short term. Some cards can be printed in more than one pack. A general rule when it comes to card prices is that the more a card is printed, the cheaper the card gets in every print of the card.

				When the price stabilizes sort of averages out and settles down, that's sort of what you could call the real value of the card. The artificial value would be something a little bit less common, but a good example of an artificial value would be something like sneak peeks and release weekends. Generally, on these days, cards will be worth a lot more than they're actually worth. That's because the supply is only just getting into the market. There is a very limited amount of cards available. And slowly, as people pull more and more, the prices go down day by day. But on the first day, if you really want your car that much, you're going to have to pay the hype price. And this is what you could call an artificial value. Supply went down, demand went up, and the car price increased.

				<br><b>Collectors</b><br>
				Yugioh has been around for a long time. Given that, countless cards have been released and some of them have become iconic in the Yugioh community. This is also partly due to the popularity of the Yugioh anime which introduced lots of players to the game when they were kids. Some collectors are willing to spend lots of money simply because of their popularity, even when being objectively bad.
				Most of these cards, due to their popularity, are being constantly reprinted but that doesn’t stop some fans from wanting the first edition of the cards. As mentioned earlier, some cards can be rereleased in different packs, but first printed versions of “first editions” of some of the more iconic cards increase in value as time passes.
				some people are willing to pay thousands of dollars for unopened booster packs just to get a small chance of pulling a wanted card. The condition of the card can also make a huge difference. There are companies that can validate the authenticity and the condition of the card and give it a number rating from one to ten. Higher the number, the higher the price. With some cards reaching tens of thousands of dollars. The most expensive card ever sold is the Tournament Black Luster Soldier which reportedly sold for $2 million.
